- Hi, I’m @Sajkil
- I’m interested in the computer science field because I love the automation of time taking activities, time that should be invested in other things that require more of our attention.
- As a college student I want to learn new interesting things, that's because I'm interested in learning computer cience.
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects that I found interesting, that have relation with my future degree in civil engineering.
- You can reach me by my e-mail: joaquinlop24k@outlook.com
